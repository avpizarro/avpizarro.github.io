# Horiseon
01-Homework Bootcamp

Changed the title to Horiseon.

Added semantic HTML elements and comments to describe each section.

Organised index.html so it follows a logical structure that is also used in style.css.

Reduced the amount of CSS selectors by consolidating the ones with the same properties.

Added a title to the hero image and moved it from CSS to html to do this.

Added empty alt attributes to decorative images so they can be ignored by screen readers.
